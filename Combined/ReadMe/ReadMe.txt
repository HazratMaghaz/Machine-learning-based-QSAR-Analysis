Absolutely — here’s a **brief and clear summary** of what you’ve accomplished so far and what’s coming next:

## ✅ **What We’ve Done So Far**

### 📌 Project 1 (Series 1 – 16 Compounds)
- Developed a 2D-QSAR model using ElasticNet
- Generated Mordred descriptors
- Converted IC50 → pIC50
- Evaluated performance: R² = 0.78, MAE = 0.10
- Performed **SHAP analysis** for feature importance
- Designed **analogs** of top 5 compounds using rule-based substitutions (CH₃, OH, Cl, Br, etc.)
- Predicted analog pIC50s and compared with parent compounds
- Delivered SAR insights & lead suggestions

---

### 📌 Project 2 Preparation (Series 2 – 10 Compounds)
- Parsed and cleaned the Series 2 dataset from DOCX → CSV
- Converted IC50 → pIC50 for uniform modeling
- Merged both datasets temporarily for comparison (not modeling)
- Performed **Tanimoto Similarity** → Most values < 0.5 ❌
- Performed **Murcko Scaffold Check** → 0 shared scaffolds ❌
- Visualized **PCA chemical space** → Strong separation ❌

> ✅ Conclusion: Series 2 is **chemically distinct** → requires its own QSAR model.

## 🔮 **Future Plan: Project 2 (Series 2 – Standalone QSAR)**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ Descriptor Generation | Use Mordred for atom-based descriptors |
| 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing | Remove low-variance, null, or correlated descriptors |
| 3️⃣ Model Training | Use **Leave-One-Out CV (LOOCV)** with ElasticNet or RandomForest |
| 4️⃣ Model Validation | Use LOOCV metrics + Y-randomization to prove model is not random |
| 5️⃣ SHAP Analysis | Identify most influential atomic descriptors |
| 6️⃣ Analog Generation | Generate 1–2 analogs for top compounds (manually or RDKit rules) |
| 7️⃣ Predict Analog Activity | Use model to estimate pIC50 of analogs |
| 8️⃣ Final Delivery | Table, plots, report with SAR and leads (optional: ADMET prediction) |
